## Project #1 Real Time Gesture Recognition
This project can use real time gesture recognition and image recognition as an interpreter for sign language, it converts sign language into a written output. I like this type of projects that make communication easy for everyone or that try to make our society more inclusive.

## Project #2 BlackJack Simulator
this project is an interesting one... it creates a simulation of a blackjack game, which may help you to develop a Winning Strategy. It can count cards and also displays graphs after the simulation
in order to have a better view on the results of the match and the chosen strategy. Beware of gambling addictions.

## Project #3 Scientific Calculator
this project replicates all the features an advanced calculator must have, you can do almost everything on it except solving integrals
and differential equations, it can make conversion with some commands listed on the project guide ( there are many commands aveilable)
and more. It has a web version so you dont have to download it.
